<h3>Overview:</h3>

<p>The OVAL Board is an advisory body, which provides valuable input on OVAL to the Moderator (currently <a href="//www.mitre.org">MITRE</a>). While it is important to have organizational support for OVAL, it is the individuals who sit on the OVAL Board and their input and activity that truly make a difference. The Board’s primary responsibilities are to work with the Moderator and the Community to define OVAL, to provide input into OVAL’s strategic direction, and to advocate OVAL in the Community.</p>

<p>Each OVAL Board member is expected to meet the following requirements:</p>

<ul>
<li>attend the quarterly board meetings (telephone calls)</li>
<li>provide input into OVAL’s strategic direction</li>
<li>actively follow and participate in both the discussion and developer email lists</li>
<li>provide expert advice about OVAL to the Community</li>
<li>look for opportunities to advocate OVAL in the Community</li>
</ul>

<p>In addition to the above requirements, an OVAL Board member is expected to look for opportunities to include OVAL in his or her organization’s products.</p>

<p>In an effort to guard against organizational bias, a single organization may be represented by a maximum of two individuals with the expectation that one individual would be focused on strategic direction and the other individual would be focused more on technical decisions.</p>

<p>If you are interested in becoming an OVAL Board member email <a href="mailto:oval@cisecurity.org">oval@cisecurity.org</a>. Potential members should be participants in the Community before looking to join the OVAL Board. The OVAL Moderator has the final say regarding membership.</p>
