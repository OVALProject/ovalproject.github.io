		<h3>Introduction</h3>
		<p>Community members are welcome to propose changes to the OVAL Language. This includes requests to:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Add new OVAL Constructs (e.g., component schemas, core capabilities, tests, entities, or functions).</li>
			<li>Modify existing OVAL Constructs.</li>
			<li>Deprecate existing OVAL Constructs.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Requests should be submitted to the <a href="http://lists.cisecurity.org/mailman/listinfo/oval_developer_lists.cisecurity.org">OVAL Developer's Forum</a> for review by the OVAL community, or directly to <a href="mailto:oval@cisecurity.org">oval@cisecurity.org</a>.

	<h3>Requests to Add New OVAL Constructs</h3>
	<p>To keep up with new technologies, platforms, and changing systems, it is often necessary to add new capabilities to the OVAL Language in order to support the collection of new system configuration information or to perform a new type of check. This may come in the form of new OVAL <a href="#new_component">Component Schemas</a>, <a href="#new_core">Core Capabilities</a>, <a href="#new_test">Tests</a>, <a href="#new_entity">Entities</a>, or <a href="#new_function">Functions</a>. Guidelines for submitting such constructs are noted below.</p>

		</div>
		<div class="panel-body">
			<p>An OVAL Component Schema is a collection of OVAL Tests, Objects, States, and Items that are related based on the platform for which they can check or describe configuration information. In order to extend the OVAL Language to a new platform, it is necessary to develop a new OVAL Component Schema for that platform. The following describes the guidelines for proposing a new OVAL Component Schema for inclusion in the OVAL Language.</p>
			<ol>
				<li>What platform is the OVAL Component Schema for? Why is it needed?</li>
				<li>Provide a brief overview of each OVAL Test included in the proposed OVAL Component Schema. Please see <a href="#new_test">Submitting a New OVAL Test</a> below for more information on what to include.</li>
				<li>Provide the OVAL Definitions and System Characteristics schemas for the proposed OVAL Component Schema.</li>
				<li>Provide sample content that demonstrates the proposed OVAL Component Schema usage.</li>

			<p>The OVAL Core consists of the OVAL Definitions, System Characteristics, Results, Variables, and Directives Schemas. Additional functionality added to these schemas is considered a new OVAL Core Capability. The following describes the guidelines for proposing a new OVAL Core Capability to the OVAL Language.</p>
			<ol>
				<li>What is the proposed OVAL Core Capability? Why is it needed?</li>
				<li>What OVAL Core Schemas are affected by this new OVAL Core Capability?</li>

				<li>Provide sample content that demonstrates the proposed OVAL Core Capability use cases.</li>
				<li>Provide the relevant documentation associated with the proposed OVAL Core Capability.</li>
				<li>OPTIONAL: Implementing the proposal in the schema is recommended, but, not required.</li>

	<h3>Requests to Deprecate OVAL Constructs</h3>
	<p>When an OVAL Construct contains security issues, results in inconsistency, or uses obsoleted technologies or methodologies it may be desirable to deprecate it in the OVAL Language.

The following describes the guidelines for requesting the deprecation of OVAL Constructs in the OVAL Language.</p>
	<ol>
		<li>What OVAL Construct should be deprecated? Why should the OVAL Construct be deprecated?</li>
		<li>Should a new OVAL Construct be recommended to replace it? If so, please refer to relevant sub-section in Submitting a Request to <a href="#new">Add New OVAL Constructs</a> above.</li>
