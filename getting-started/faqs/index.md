	<h3><a name="a"></a>A. OVAL</h3>
	<h4 class=""><a name="a1"></a>A1. What is OVAL?</h4>
		<p>Open Vulnerability and Assessment Language (OVAL®) is an international, information security, community standard to promote open and publicly available security content, and to standardize the transfer of this information across the entire spectrum of security tools and services. OVAL includes a language used to encode system details, and an assortment of content repositories held throughout the community. The language standardizes the three main steps of the assessment process: representing configuration information of systems for testing; analyzing the system for the presence of the specified machine state (vulnerability, configuration, patch state, etc.); and reporting the results of this assessment. The repositories are collections of publicly available and open content that utilize the language. See <a href="http://oval.mitre.org/about/index.html">About OVAL</a> for additional information.</p>
	<h4><a name="a2"></a>A2. Why OVAL? Is there a lot of support for something like this?</h4>
		<p>Until OVAL there was no common or structured means for system administrators and other end users to determine the existence of software vulnerabilities, configuration issues, programs, and/or patches in local systems. Much of the information was available as text-based descriptions from vulnerability and other knowledge sources such as software vendors, government agencies, tool vendors, and security consulting firms, however, it remained a labor-intensive and error-prone process for system administrators to read and interpret this unstructured information and make a determination of whether a particular vulnerability or configuration issue existed on a local system.</p>
		<p>For operating system and application software vendors, the precise definitions of how to detect vulnerabilities or configuration issues found in OVAL definitions eliminate the need for exploit code as an assessment tool. And tool vendors who implemented closed and proprietary tests to check for the vulnerabilities implemented them in procedural code that could not be easily read and understood by a wide audience, if they made that code available at all.</p>
		<p>OVAL solves these problems. The widespread availability of OVAL definitions will promote standardized vulnerability and configuration assessment and will provide consistent and reproducible information assurance metrics. Tools for collecting configuration information can be combined with OVAL content to provide for standardized assessment, resulting in more accurate determinations of existence and fewer false positives than what currently exists today. In addition, since OVAL definitions express security problems in a language familiar to system administrators, they will have a concrete and actionable impact on the specific group directly involved in security remediation efforts.</p>
		<p>An integral component of OVAL is community involvement and support. OVAL
		  definitions are based on a common XML definition schema approved by the <a href="/board">OVAL
		Board</a>, which includes members from major operating systems vendors,
		commercial information security tool vendors, academia, government agencies,
		and research institutions. Broad community participation in the OVAL effort
		comes from system administrators, software vendors, security analysts, and
		other members of the information security community reviewing and commenting
		on the OVAL schemas on the <a href="http://oval.mitre.org/community/registration.html">Developer’s
		Forum</a> and/or reviewing each draft definition and discussing and debating
		it on the <a href="http://oval.mitre.org/community/index.html">Community
		Forum</a>, both of which are hosted on the OVAL Web site. This means the
		OVAL Language schema and definitions will reflect the insights and combined expertise
		of the broadest possible collection of security and system administration
		professionals.</p>
		<div align="right" style="margin:5px 0px 5px 0px; clear:right"><a class="backtop" href="#top">Back to top</a></div>
	<h4><a name="a3"></a>A3. What operating system platforms are supported?</h4>
		<p>Refer to the <a href="https://github.com/OVALProject/Language">Language Releases</a> page, and the <a href="http://oval.mitre.org/repository/index.html">OVAL Repository</a>, for the specific OS versions supported.</p>
	<h4><a name="a4"></a>A4. How is OVAL different from commercial vulnerability scanners?</h4>
		<p>OVAL itself is not a vulnerability scanner. Rather, it is an open language to express checks for determining whether software vulnerabilities—and configuration issues, programs, and patches—exist on a system. OVAL allows the sharing of technical details regarding how to identify the presence or absence of vulnerabilities on a computer system. The public nature of OVAL provides computer security researchers, software vendors, and system administrators with the means to collaborate to develop OVAL definitions. The end user of an OVAL-compliant tool benefits from this collaboration because of increased quality from the number of experts participating in the development of definitions, and now has the option of personally reviewing the individual definitions to see exactly how the vulnerability determination was made. This is in direct contrast to closed, proprietary methods of vulnerability assessment.</p>
		<p>MITRE’s freely available <a href="http://oval.mitre.org/language/interpreter.html">OVAL Interpreter</a> demonstrates the evaluation of OVAL Definitions. Based on a set of Definitions the interpreter collects system information, evaluates it, and generates a detailed OVAL Results file. It demonstrates OVAL in action, but has a limited user interface. (See <a href="#f1">F1. What is the OVAL Interpreter? Is it free to use?</a>).</p>
	<h4><a name="a5"></a>A5. Can’t hackers use this to break into my system?</h4>
		<p>Any public discussion or availability of vulnerability and configuration information may help a hacker. However, there are several reasons why the benefits of OVAL outweigh its risks:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>OVAL is restricted to publicly known configuration issues and vulnerabilities.</li>
			<li>OVAL definitions help users determine the presence of vulnerabilities or configuration issues on systems before they can be exploited.</li>
			<li>You must have root-level or system administrator access to employ the vulnerability information in an OVAL definition.</li>
			<li>The availability of the detailed technical information about vulnerabilities or configuration issues in OVAL definitions reduces the need for releasing exploit code to the public.</li>
			<li>There is a shift in community opinion towards sharing information, as reflected in the success of the collaborative nature of MITRE’s <a href="http://cve.mitre.org/" target="_blank">CVE
			Initiative</a>, and the fact that the <a href="/board">OVAL
			Board</a> includes key organizations in information security.</li>
		</ul>
	<h4><a name="a6"></a>A6. Can OVAL help me protect my system?</h4>
		<p>Yes, but only as a preventative measure. Once you have used OVAL definitions or OVAL-compatible information security products and services to determine which vulnerabilities or configuration issues exist on your system, you may then use this information to obtain appropriate software patches and fix information for remediation from your vendors or from vulnerability research databases and Web sites.</p>
	<h4><a name="a7"></a>A7. Does OVAL tell me how to fix my system?</h4>
		<p>No. OVAL can only help you determine if there are vulnerabilities or configuration issues on your system. You must obtain all instructions, software patches, or remediation information from your vendors or information security advisories in order to address your system vulnerabilities or configuration issues.</p>
	<h4><a name="a8"></a>A8. Isn’t the vulnerability information included in OVAL also in vulnerability databases?</h4>
	<p>Vulnerability databases include information about vulnerabilities that OVAL does not, such as the severity of the problem, whether it is locally or remotely exploitable, remediation information, and so on. Instead, OVAL definitions provide a detailed method for checking low-level configuration parameters on a computer to determine the presence or absence of software vulnerabilities. Vulnerability databases rarely have this kind of technical detail available.</p>
	<h4><a name="a9"></a>A9. How can OVAL help me?</h4>
	<p>Use OVAL definitions or OVAL-compatible information security products and services as they become available to determine which, if any, software vulnerabilities, configuration issues, programs, or patches exist on your system (See <a href="#f1">F1. What is the OVAL Interpreter? Is it free to use?</a>). Obtain appropriate fix information and software patches from your vendors and make the repairs. See <a href="#a2">A2. Why OVAL?</a> and the <a href="http://oval.mitre.org/about/index.html">About OVAL</a> page for additional information.</p>
		<h4><a name="a10"></a>A10. Who owns OVAL?</h4>
		<p>OVAL is an open community effort and is sponsored by the office of <a href="http://www.dhs.gov/office-cybersecurity-and-communications/" target="_blank">Cybersecurity and Communications</a> at the <a href="http://www.dhs.gov/" target="_blank">U.S. Department of Homeland Security</a>. Operating as DHS’s Federally Funded Research and Development Center (FFRDC), <a href="http://www.mitre.org/" target="_blank">MITRE</a> has copyrighted the <a href="https://github.com/OVALProject/Language">OVAL Language</a> for the benefit of the community in order to ensure it remains a free and open standard, as well as to legally protect the ongoing use of it and any resulting content by government, vendors, and/or users. In addition, MITRE has trademarked ® the OVAL acronym and the OVAL logo to protect their sole and ongoing use by the OVAL effort within the information security arena.</p>
		<p>The content of OVAL is a result of the collaborative efforts of <a href="http://www.mitre.org/" target="_blank">MITRE</a> and the <a href="/board">OVAL Board</a>, along with broad participation from the information security community. The Board includes representatives from numerous organizations such as operating system and security tool vendors, academic institutions, and government.</p>
	<h4><a name="a11"></a>A11. How can my organization and I be involved?</h4>
		<p>An integral component of the OVAL effort is broad community participation. Visit the <a href="http://oval.mitre.org/community/index.html">OVAL Community</a> page for additional information.</p>
	<h4><a name="a12"></a>A12. Is someone from OVAL available to speak or participate on panel discussions at industry-related events, meetings, etc.?</h4>
		<p>Yes, contact <a href="mailto:oval@mitre.org">oval@mitre.org</a> to have MITRE present a briefing or participate in a panel discussion about <a href="http://oval.mitre.org/">OVAL</a> or <a href="http://measurablesecurity.mitre.org/" target="_blank">Making Security Measurable</a>, security automation, and/or related topics at your event.</p>
	<h4><a name="a13"></a>A13. What is the relationship between OVAL and DHS?</h4>
		<p>OVAL is sponsored by the office of <a href="http://www.dhs.gov/office-cybersecurity-and-communications/" target="_blank">Cybersecurity and Communications</a> at the <a href="http://www.dhs.gov/" target="_blank">U.S. Department of Homeland Security</a>. <a href="http://www.mitre.org/" target="_blank">MITRE</a>, operating as DHS’s Federally Funded Research and Development Center (FFRDC), manages this OVAL Web site, community engagement, and discussion lists to enable open and public collaboration with all stakeholders.</p>
	<h4><a name="a14"></a>A14. Does OVAL participate in link exchange arrangements?</h4>
		<p>No, OVAL does not exchange links with other Web sites. Only authorized links are allowed on the OVAL Web site such as references for OVAL content in the <a href="http://oval.mitre.org/repository/index.html">OVAL 
		Repository</a> and those for the <a href="http://oval.mitre.org/adoption/index.html">OVAL Adoption Program</a>, <a href="/board">OVAL Board
		Members</a>, and <a href="http://oval.mitre.org/news/index.html">News</a> about OVAL.</p>
		<h4><a name="a15" id="a15"></a>A15. Does OVAL offer RSS feeds?</h4>
		<p>See <a href="http://oval.mitre.org/rss.html">OVAL RSS Feeds</a>.</p>
		<h4><a name="a16" id="a16"></a>A16. What are OVAL-IDs?</h4>
		<p>OVAL identifiers (OVAL-IDs) are assigned to all globally reusable components 
		  in the OVAL Language including OVAL definitions, objects, states, tests, 
		  and variables. OVAL-IDs use the format "oval:Organization DNS Name:ID 
		  Type:ID Value" where organization DNS Name is of the form ‘org.mitre.oval’; 
		  ID Type denotes the entity to which the ID is being applied (and can 
		  be one of the following values: def - Definition, obj - Object, ste 
		  - State, tst - Test, or var - Variable); and ID Value is an integer 
		  that is unique to the DNS name and ID Type pair that precedes it. For 
		  example, <a href="http://oval.mitre.org/repository/data/item/show?id=oval:org.mitre.oval:def:1115">oval:org.mitre.oval:def:1115</a> 
		  or <a href="https://www.redhat.com/security/data/oval/com.redhat.rhsa-20060742.xml" target="_blank">oval:com.redhat.rhsa:def:20060742</a>.</p>
		<h4><a name="a17" id="a17"></a>A17. How do I use OVAL on my system?</h4>
		<p>To evaluate a set of OVAL Definitions on a single Windows 7 system, download and install the free <a href="http://oval.mitre.org/language/interpreter.html">OVAL Interpreter</a>. The Interpreter is a reference implementation of the <a href="https://github.com/OVALProject/Language">OVAL Language</a> and demonstrates how OVAL Definitions, which are community-developed tests that check for the presence of software vulnerabilities, configuration issues, programs, and patches, can be evaluated on a single computer system. Next, get the latest set of OVAL Definitions hosted in the <a href="http://oval.mitre.org/repository/index.html">OVAL Repository</a> — for example, get the latest set of vulnerability definitions for Windows 7 from 
		<a href="http://oval.mitre.org/rep-data/5.10/org.mitre.oval/v/platform/microsoft.windows.7.xml">https://oval.mitre.org/rep-data/5.10/org.mitre.oval/v/platform/microsoft.windows.7.xml</a> — and run them against your system with the Interpreter. You may then review the results that are produced in the default Simple HTML View (see "results.html" in the same directory as the OVAL Interpreter).</p>
		<h4><a name="a18" id="a18"></a>A18. Is OVAL free for public use?</h4>

	<h3><a name="b"></a>B. OVAL Language</h3>
	<h4><a name="b1"></a>B1. What is the OVAL Language?</h4>
		<p>The OVAL Language standardizes the three main steps of the assessment process: representing configuration information of systems for testing; analyzing the system for the presence of the specified machine state (vulnerability, configuration, patch state, etc.); and reporting the results of this assessment.</p>
		<p>The OVAL community has developed three schemas written in Extensible Markup Language (XML) to serve as the framework and vocabulary of the OVAL Language. These schemas correspond to the three steps of the assessment process: an OVAL System Characteristics schema for representing system information, an OVAL Definition schema for expressing a specific machine state, and an OVAL Results schema for reporting the results of an assessment.</p>
		<p>See <a href="http://oval.mitre.org/language/about/index.html">About the OVAL Language</a> for more information.</p>
	<h4><a name="b2"></a>B2. Why XML?</h4>
		<p>Every OVAL definition on the OVAL Web site is posted in Extensible Markup Language (XML) under a single OVAL-ID. XML is used as the framework for <a href="http://oval.mitre.org/repository/index.html">OVAL
		Definitions</a> because XML’s data centric approach makes it easier to extract the logical criteria of a definition and allows it to be combined with other XML data in order to extend the usefulness of OVAL.</p>
		<p>Because they are written in XML, OVAL definitions are machine readable and can be used as part of information security products and services, or the pseudocode can be read in hardcopy or electronic form by information security professionals such as system administrators, security analysts, etc. For tool vendors, XML are specifications and not implementation requirements. The XML information in OVAL can be converted into whatever implementation structure or format necessary for your tool or service.</p>
		<p>Information about XML and programming in XML can be found in numerous locations on the Internet, including the <a href="http://www.w3.org/" target="_blank">World
		Wide Web Consortium</a> Web site, through search engines such as <a href="http://www.google.com/" target="_blank">Google</a>, <a href="http://www.yahoo.com/" target="_blank">Yahoo</a>, etc., in bookstores, or at your local library.</p>
	<h4><a name="b3"></a>B3. Who created the OVAL schemas?</h4>
		<p>The OVAL schemas are created by <a href="http://www.mitre.org/" target="_blank">MITRE</a> and members of the <a href="http://oval.mitre.org/community/index.html">OVAL Developer’s Forum</a> and approved by the OVAL Board. Visit the <a href="https://github.com/OVALProject/Language">OVAL Language Releases</a> page to review or download the schemas. The schemas are also hosted on the <a href="https://github.com/OVALProject/Language" target="_blank">OVALProject Language page on GitHub.com</a>.</p>
	<h4><a name="b4"></a>B4. Is there technical documentation that explains the XML elements, types, and attributes that comprise the OVAL Schemas?</h4>
		<p>Yes, OVAL Element Dictionaries for the latest version of OVAL are available in the <a href="https://github.com/OVALProject/Language">OVAL Language</a> section.</p>
		<h4><a name="b5"></a>B5. Is there an OVAL Language "Sandbox"?</h4>
		<p>Yes, the <a href="https://github.com/OVALProject/Sandbox" target="_blank">OVAL Language Sandbox</a>, hosted on <a href="https://github.com/" target="_blank">GitHub.com</a>, provides a collaborative environment for the community to propose and develop experimental capabilities for the OVAL Language. It allows the community to fully investigate and implement new capabilities before including them in an official release ensuring that only mature and implementable constructs are added to the <a href="https://github.com/OVALProject/Language">OVAL Language</a>. It also allows the OVAL effort to evolve and keep up with new and emerging technologies.</p>

	<h3><a name="c"></a>C. OVAL  Repository</h3>
	<h4><a name="c1"></a>C1. What is the OVAL  Repository?</h4>
		<p>The <a href="http://oval.mitre.org/repository/index.html">OVAL  Repository</a> is the central meeting place for the OVAL
		  Community to discuss, analyze, store, and disseminate <a href="http://oval.mitre.org/repository/index.html">OVAL
		definitions</a>. OVAL definitions are standardized, machine-readable tests written in the Open Vulnerability and Assessment Language that check computer systems for the presence of software vulnerabilities, configuration issues, programs, and patches.</p>
		<p>OVAL definitions, which are free to use and implement in information security
		  products and services, are written in Extensible Mark-up Language (<a href="#b2">XML</a>)
		  and are available for most major platforms. See the <a href="http://oval.mitre.org/repository/index.html">OVAL
		  Repository</a> main page to review or download all OVAL definitions posted
		  to date.</p>
	<h4><a name="c2"></a>C2. What is OVAL content?</h4>
		<p>OVAL content includes any XML document written in the OVAL Language. For example, OVAL Definitions, OVAL System Characteristics files, and OVAL Results files.</p>
		<h4><a name="c3"></a>C3. What information is included in an OVAL definition?</h4>
		<p>"OVAL definitions" are machine-readable, gold standard tests that definitively determine whether the specified software vulnerability, configuration issue, program, or patch is present on a system. There are four main classes of OVAL definitions:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><a href="http://oval.mitre.org/repository/index.html">OVAL Vulnerability Definitions</a> — Tests that determine the presence of vulnerabilities on systems.</li>
			<li><a href="http://oval.mitre.org/repository/index.html">OVAL Compliance Definitions</a> — Tests that determine whether the configuration settings of a system meets a security policy.</li>
			<li><a href="http://oval.mitre.org/repository/index.html">OVAL Inventory Definitions</a> — Tests that whether a specific piece of software is installed on the system.</li>
			<li><a href="http://oval.mitre.org/repository/index.html">OVAL Patch Definitions</a> — Tests that determine whether a particular patch is appropriate for a system.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>A "Miscellaneous" class is also available for definitions that
		  do not fall into any of the four main classes. Each OVAL definition
		  includes metadata, a high-level summary, and the detailed definition. Definition
		  metadata provides the OVAL-ID, status of the definition (Draft, Interim,
		  or Accepted), the CVE name or other reference on which the definition (or
		  definitions) is based, the version of the official <a href="http://oval.mitre.org/language/index.html">OVAL
		Definition Schema</a> the definition works with, a brief description of
		the security issue covered in the definition, the main author, and a list
		of the significant contributors to the development of the definition.</p>
		<p>The high-level summary includes the following: "Vulnerable software exists," which
		  states the specific operating system (OS), the name of the file with the
		  vulnerability in it, application version, and patch status; and "Vulnerable
		  configuration," which indicates if the service is running or not, specific
		  configuration settings, and workarounds. The detailed portion of definitions
		  provides the logic for checking for the system characteristics (OS installed,
		  settings in the OS, software applications installed, and settings in applications)
		  to indicate that vulnerable software exists, and configuration attributes
		  (registry key values, file system attributes, and configuration files) to
		indicate that a vulnerable configuration exists.</p>
		<p>Each definition is distinguished by a unique identifier (OVAL-ID). 
		  OVAL-IDs use the format "oval:Organization DNS Name:ID Type:ID 
		  Value" where organization DNS Name is of the form ‘org.mitre.oval’; 
		  ID Type denotes the entity to which the ID is being applied (and can 
		  be one of the following values: def - Definition, obj - Object, ste 
		  - State, tst - Test, or var - Variable); and ID Value is an integer 
		  that is unique to the DNS name and ID Type pair that precedes it. For 
		  example, <a href="http://oval.mitre.org/repository/data/item/show?id=oval:org.mitre.oval:def:1115">oval:org.mitre.oval:def:1115</a>. 
		  (Note that the OVAL-ID format extends across all of the globally reusable 
		  components in the OVAL Language - definitions, objects, states, tests, 
		  and variables.)</p>
		<p>(Important: OVAL deprecated the use of the SQL format in November 2004. 
		  Any SQL versions of OVAL definitions should be considered to be for 
		  informational purposes only.)</p>
	<h4><a name="c4"></a>C4. Who decides what goes in the OVAL definitions?</h4>
		<p>The OVAL Repository Moderator evaluates and reviews definitions for publication in the
		 OVAL Repository. Once new definitions are published the OVAL Repository they are subject
		 to community review. This community review takes place on the <a href="http://oval.mitre.org/community/index.html">Community Forum Discussion List</a>, an email list hosted on the OVAL Web site.</p>
	<div align="right" style="margin:5px 0px 5px 0px; clear:right"><a class="backtop" href="#top">Back to top</a></div>
	<h4><a name="c5"></a>C5. How does a vulnerability or exposure become an OVAL definition?</h4>
		<p>The OVAL Repository uses the publicly known vulnerabilities identified in the 
				 <a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cve" target="_blank">CVE List</a> as the basis 
				 for its vulnerability definitions. Draft definitions against these 
				 vulnerabilities, configuration issues, and patches are written by members of
				 the OVAL Repository community and submitted to the OVAL Repository Moderator for
				 public comment and review. Public comments on new definitions are made on the
				 Discussion List, a lightly moderated public forum for discussing the definitions in 
				 the OVAL Repository. After discussion has subsided, any modifications
				 to new definitions are published in the <a href="http://oval.mitre.org/repository/index.html">OVAL Repository</a>. 
				 Definitions are posted with "DRAFT," "INTERIM," or 
				 "ACCEPTED" status. (See "<a href="http://oval.mitre.org/repository/about/stages.html">OVAL Definition Lifecycle </a>" for a detailed description of this process.)</p>
	<h4><a name="c6"></a>C6. Where does OVAL find out about the vulnerabilities used in the Vulnerability Definitions?</h4>
		<p>Most OVAL vulnerability definitions are based on the publicly known vulnerabilities identified in MITRE’s CVE List (<a href="#c7">see
		C7</a>). This information comes from a variety of public sources including the application and operating system vendors themselves, security tool vendors, public vulnerability databases, and as a direct result of the open discussions on OVAL’s <a href="http://oval.mitre.org/community/index.html">Community
		Forum</a> email list.</p>
		<p>On occasion, discussions on the community discussion list may bring to light new potential security vulnerabilities (<a href="#c12">see
		C12</a>). In these instances, the relevant information will be forwarded to the CVE Initiative and if accepted, the issue will be assigned a CVE name with candidate status. Any subsequent OVAL definitions developed for this newly identified problem will include this CVE name.</p>
	<h4><a name="c7"></a>C7. Do the OVAL Definitions address all vulnerabilities and exposures?</h4>
		<p>No. The intention of OVAL is to be comprehensive with respect to the most recent vulnerabilities identified on the <a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cve" target="_blank">CVE
		List</a> for the platforms supported (<a href="#a3">see A3</a>).</p>
	<h4><a name="c8"></a>C8. What is CVE? What is the relationship between CVE and OVAL?</h4>
		<p>Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE®) is a list or dictionary that provides common names for publicly known information security vulnerabilities and exposures. CVE common names make it easier to share data across separate network security databases and tools that are CVE-compatible. CVE also provides a baseline for evaluating the coverage of an organization’s security tools. CVE content is determined by the CVE Editorial Board, which is composed of experts from the international information security community. The MITRE Corporation maintains CVE and manages the CVE Editorial Board. See <a href="http://cve.mitre.org/" target="_blank">http://cve.mitre.org</a>.</p>
		<p>OVAL uses the publicly known vulnerabilities identified in CVE List as the basis for most of the OVAL vulnerability definitions (<a href="#c5">see
		C5</a>). If discussions in the Community Forum result in information about new and previously unreported vulnerabilities, this information and any supporting references will be forwarded to the CVE Initiative for possible addition to the list. MITRE manages both CVE and OVAL and the two teams work closely together.</p>

	<h4><a name="c9"></a>C9. Are the OVAL definitions intended for public use?</h4>
		<p>OVAL’s definitions and Language schemas are all free to download, use, reference, and implement, per the <a href="http://oval.mitre.org/about/termsofuse.html">Terms
		of Use</a>. Members of the community are welcome to comment on OVAL’s definitions and schemas on the <a href="http://oval.mitre.org/community/index.html">Community
		Forum</a> and <a href="http://oval.mitre.org/community/index.html">Developer’s Forum</a>.</p>
	<h4><a name="c10"></a>C10. How can I get the latest copies of the OVAL definitions? What do they cost, and are there any licensing fees?</h4>
		<p>You may review or download OVAL definitions from the main page of the <a href="http://oval.mitre.org/repository/index.html">OVAL
		 Repository</a>. All OVAL definitions—as well as all schemas and downloads on the OVAL Web site—are free to the public to use, download, reference, and implement with no licensing fees or restrictions as to their use. See the full <a href="http://oval.mitre.org/about/termsofuse.html">Terms
		of Use</a> statement for details.</p>
	<h4><a name="c11"></a>C11. Can my organization or I submit OVAL definitions?</h4>
		<p>Yes. Members of the information security community may submit definitions
		  to the OVAL Editor for review. Definitions must be based upon the OVAL Definition schema
		  and the <a href="http://oval.mitre.org/repository/about/submission.html">Submission
		Guidelines</a>. See <a href="http://oval.mitre.org/repository/about/submission.html">Submit Content</a> for the specific steps and requirements.</p>
	<h4><a name="c12"></a>C12. Can I include OVAL definition information in my product/security advisory/etc.?</h4>
		<p>Yes. OVAL definition information is free to use.</p>
	<h4><a name="c13"></a>C13. I discovered a new security problem, how can I get it added to the OVAL Repository?</h4>
		<p>Except for software configuration issues, programs, and patches, OVAL definitions are based on vulnerability
			 information from CVE entries. If new vulnerabilities come to light in discussions on OVAL’s public discussion 
			 email list, the information will be forwarded to the CVE Initiative.</p>
		<p>Alternatively, after first contacting the vendor, you could post information to mailing lists such as Bugtraq
			  or NTBugtraq. Or, you could contact a vulnerability analysis team, an emergency response team such as CERT, or 
			  other organizations that are specifically designed to handle such new information. Once the information has been 
			  verified through these other mechanisms, the new entries will make it into CVE and then be available to OVAL.</p>
		<h4><a name="c14" id="c14"></a>C14. How do I search the Repository by 
		  OVAL-ID?</h4>
		<p>The OVAL Repository’s <a href="http://oval.mitre.org/repository/data/search/index">Search</a> page allows users to Search by OVAL-ID for any component in the OVAL Language that 
		  has been assigned an OVAL-ID including OVAL definitions, objects, states, 
		  tests, and variables (See <a href="#a16">A16. What 
		  is an OVAL-ID?</a>). </p>
		<p>You may “Search by OVAL-ID” by entering any of the following:</p>
		<p><strong>Definition ID</strong> – Searches the OVAL Repository 
		  for the single definition with the specified ID, for example searching 
		  for “oval:com.example:def:123” would return a url for that 
		  definition.</p>
		<p><strong>Definition Type &amp; Integer</strong> – Searches the 
		  OVAL Repository for all definitions regardless of namespace that have 
		  the specified integer component. For example, searching for “def:123” 
		  would return the following results: oval:com.example:def:123, oval:org.mitre.oval:def:123, 
		  oval:com.abc:def:123, etc.</p>
		<p><strong>Integer-only</strong> – Searches the OVAL Repository 
		  for all OVAL Definitions whose Definition ID has the specified integer 
		  component. For example, searching for “123” would return 
		  the following results: oval:com.example:def:123, oval:org.mitre.oval:def:123, 
		  oval:com.abc:def:123, etc.</p>
		<p><strong>ID Type &amp; Integer</strong> – Searches the OVAL Repository 
		  for all definitions that use any OVAL-ID of the specified ID Type with 
		  the specified integer components. For example, searching for “tst:123” 
		  returns all definitions that use any test with the specified type and 
		  integer components. See the example above for how to search for ‘def’ 
		  type.</p>
		<p><strong>Compete ID Other than Definition ID</strong> – Searches 
		  the OVAL Repository for any definitions that use the specified ID, for 
		  example, “oval:com.example:obj:123”. See above for how to 
		  search by “Definition ID,” which is handled differently.</p> 
		<h4><a name="c15" id="c15"></a>C15. How do I search the Repository by 
		  OVAL Metadata?</h4>
		<p>The OVAL Repository’s <a href="http://oval.mitre.org/repository/data/search/index">Search</a> page allows users to search OVAL Definitions by any combination 
		  of the following: title, description, platform, product, contributor, 
		  organization, class, family, status, reference source, and/or reference 
		  number. You may also search by OVAL-ID (see <a href="#c14">C14. 
		  How do I search the Repository by OVAL-ID?)</a>. </p>
		<p>OVAL Tests, Objects, States, and Variables may also be searched on by their metadata.</p>
